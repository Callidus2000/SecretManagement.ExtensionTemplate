<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

This Powershell Module is a template for building your own extension to the [Microsoft Secret Management Module](https://github.com/PowerShell/SecretManagement) for accessing secrets stored somewhere. It was created after building the [Netwrix Password Secure](https://github.com/Callidus2000/SecretManagement.NetwrixPasswordSecure) extension and has the focus to provide an easy access to best practises.


### Built With

* [PSModuleDevelopment](https://github.com/PowershellFrameworkCollective/PSModuleDevelopment)
* [PSFramework](https://github.com/PowershellFrameworkCollective/psframework)
* [RestartableSession](https://github.com/mdgrs-mei/RestartableSession)

Without Fred's PSModuleDevelopment module neither the Netwrix nor this module would have been created. This module uses his templating engine and contains a mixture of two already existing templates.

The **RestartableSession** module is a special case: I've added it to the required modules list even the module itself does not need it.
Why?
Without it I'd never survived the debugging madness of the multi-runspace-model of SecretManagement itself. And I've included this as a best practice in the template for you. Trust me, it's invaluable.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites

- Powershell 7.x (Core) (If possible get the latest version)  
  Maybe it's working under 5.1, just did not test it

## Installation

The releases are published in the Powershell Gallery, therefor it is quite simple:
```powershell
  install-module SecretManagement.ExtensionTemplate -Scope CurrentUser
```

If you want to create a new module for (fictional) the password solution OctoPass in the current directory use
```Powershell
Invoke-SMETemplate -NewExtensionName OctoPass  -FunctionPrefix OP
```

As a result you now have the sub directory 'SecretManagement.OctoPass' which contains an extension module suitable for SecretManagement. If not already done I'd advise to read [the official documentation](https://github.com/PowerShell/SecretManagement), especially [about the architecture](https://github.com/PowerShell/SecretManagement/blob/master/Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). If possible I'd like to not copy basic info to this readme.

# Special included workarounds
Some of the characteristics of the module can send you to the madhouse faster than you would like. A few of them are minor nuisance which has to be known, others are rather nightmares which haunt your whole development session.

The following chapters describe the problems and how either
- Is dealt with in the template,
- can be avoided in the developing phase or
- you yourself can avoid while implementing the backend code

dsdf

- Shared internal functions
- Unterscheiden zwischen installierter und Dev-Nutzung (config.ps1)
- $AdditionalParameters = @{} + $AdditionalParameters
- Wait-PSFMessage before throw
- RSSession
- Dedicated Console Appender
- get


<!-- ROADMAP -->
# Roadmap
New features/changes will be added if somebody needs it or stumbles over a bug.

I've created it purely to write down insights which caused a lot of headaches while writing my own module. If no one uses the template and if I do not stumble over the need for another vault extension the template might never change again.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Callidus2000/SecretManagement.ExtensionTemplate/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

If you need a special function feel free to contribute to the project.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
# Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. For more details please take a look at the [CONTRIBUTE](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#Contributing-to-this-repository) document

Short stop:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request


# Limitations
* Maybe there are some inconsistencies in the docs, which may result in a mere copy/paste marathon from my other projects

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -->
# Acknowledgements

* [Friedrich Weinmann](https://github.com/FriedrichWeinmann) for his marvelous [PSModuleDevelopment](https://github.com/PowershellFrameworkCollective/PSModuleDevelopment) and [psframework](https://github.com/PowershellFrameworkCollective/psframework). My own extension and my template are build on base of his templates.
* [mdgrs-mei](https://github.com/mdgrs-mei) for his invaluable [RestartableSession](https://github.com/mdgrs-mei/RestartableSession) module. Without it I'd never survived the debugging madness of the multi-runspace-model of SecretManagement itself. And that would have killed my module and this template directly in the beginning.
